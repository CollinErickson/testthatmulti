Title: Testing for R Packages with Multiple Attempts for Noisy Tests
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Collin Erickson
Maintainer: Collin Erickson <collinberickson@gmail.com>
Description: Runs tests using the 'testthat' package but allows for multiple
    attempts for a single test. This is useful for noisy or flaky tests
    that generally pass but can fail due to occasional random errors,
    such as numeric instability or using random data.
